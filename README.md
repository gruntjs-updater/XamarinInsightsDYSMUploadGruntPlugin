# Xamarin Insights DYSM upload Grunt plugin

Inspired by a [gist](https://gist.github.com/robert-waggott/528238a7fb2893db97fd) and [blog post](http://thetechnologystudio.co.uk/blog/uploading-your-ios-dysm-to-xamarin-insights-using-grunt/) I recently wrote on uploading a DYSM to Xamarin insights through grunt this plugin is intended to simplify the process even further.
